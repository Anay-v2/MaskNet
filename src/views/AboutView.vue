        In a world where the lines between reality and simulation blur, one thing remains constant:
        Only the capable survive.

        MaskNet is more than just a platform. It's the control center for a high-stakes digital battlefield — a world hidden beneath the surface of your screen, where identity is stripped, fate is encoded, and survival depends on your ability to adapt, deceive, and outmaneuver.

        Each player enters anonymously.
        No faces. No names.
        Only a number, a mask, and a chance.

        We provide the system — the interface, the logic, the rules — but we don’t guarantee fairness. Every choice you make shapes your path. Form alliances. Betray them. Play the games. Break the games.
        Or let the games break you.

        Behind every blinking light is a story.
        Behind every challenge, a purpose.
        Behind every rule... a lie.

        We are the Architects, but the code writes itself now.
        You are part of something bigger — or maybe you were never part of it at all.

        Welcome to MaskNet.
        Your survival starts here.
